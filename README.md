# Economic Indicators & Inflation Analysis (2010–2025)

## Objective
This project analyzes global economic indicators — GDP, inflation,
unemployment, and economic growth — to identify long-term trends
and relationships across developed and emerging economies.

## Dataset

- Coverage: 2010–2025  
- Countries: 19  

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Questions
- How do GDP levels compare across countries?
- Which countries show stronger long-term economic growth?
- How does inflation differ across economies in 2024?
- What is the relationship between inflation and economic growth over time?
- How did Canada’s economy evolve after 2020?

## Key Insights
- Emerging economies show higher growth but greater volatility.
- High inflation is associated with slower economic growth.
- Developed economies tend to have lower but more stable growth.

  and moderating inflation after 2022.
